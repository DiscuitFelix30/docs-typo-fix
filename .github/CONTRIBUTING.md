# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for contributing to the repository! This guide will give you an overview of different ways you can contribute, including the different types of issues, and how to properly open PRs.

## Issues

### Opening an issue

You can open an issue by heading to the Issues tab and clicking on New issue. This should then provide you with some options for different types of issues, select one and fill out the details. Be as clear and concise as possible, so that it is easy to understand and fix the issue. Also, make sure that the issue you are opening has not been opened already by someone else, since duplicate issues don't help solve the problem and only take up more unnecessary space. If you do find an open or closed issue with the problem you are having, you can add your own comment to it, and we will try our best to address it ASAP.

### Types of issues

There are different types of issues you can open, meant for different purposes. Below is a short explanation of what each type of issue does. Please try to make sure you open the correct type of issue, as it would help organise open issues and make it easier to go through them.

#### Bug

This type of issue is related to any bugs you find in the website, such as a rendering issue or a certain element or font not displaying properly. If you've found a bug in the website, let us know what and where it is. A screenshot would be helpful too. Before you do submit the issue, make sure that you're using the latest versions of both your OS and browser, and test that the bug shows up even after updating. This would seriously help clearing up unnecessary issues that shouldn't have been opened in the first place, and would save time.

#### Error

This type of issue is related to any errors you find in the content. This can include links not working, an incorrect piece of information that may have slipped in (We make mistakes sometimes!), clearer wording, or any other improvements that you think would improve the quality of the content.

#### Suggestion

This type of issue is to make any suggestions for content to be added. This can range from a small section on one of the existing pages, for instance to enhance the quality of the content, to adding new pages or sections.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

### Getting started

There are build instructions in the READMEs for each site in this repository so that you can get started working on the website. Before you make a PR for your change, ensure that you have been assigned an issue for it first. If you would like to work on an existing issue, leave a comment in that issue saying so, and it will be assigned to you. If an issue does not exist for the change you would like to make, open an issue first, state that you'd like to work on it, and wait for it to be assigned to you.

### Testing

Before you open a PR, make sure that the changes you make actually work and don't cause errors in the site. The instructions to run the site locally have been provided in the README. The deploy preview is also available to ensure that the PR works properly.

### Opening a PR

Once you have made your changes and tested them, and you are confident that you've got everything right, you can open a PR. Once you do this, one of the maintainers will go through it and suggest any modifications in order to refine your PR further.

If you open a draft PR, no suggestions will be made without specifically being asked for them. All open PRs (except drafts) will be rebased to match the main branch before they are merged in, so it is your responsibility to keep pulling changes from main and fix issues if they arise.
